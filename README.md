# Identifying non-cooperative participation in web-based elicitation of Acceptability Judgments

This repository contains supplementary materials to the methods described in Chapter 5 (Control by analyses: latency- and response-based identification of non-cooperative participants) of [Pieper, Börner, Kiss (2023)](https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/006514), in particular source code for ReMFOD (*recursive multi-factorial outlier detection*) for identifying underperforming participants by means of RTs (see section 5.1) and for the computation of reasonable thresholds in terms of probabilities to pass control/attention trials by chance in order to *reliably* determine which participants failed on these (see section 5.2). The markdown files show how tables and figures of the paper have been created. 

To illustrate the methods used, we used the experimental materials of the LS and FC studies described in [Kiss, Pieper, Börner (2021)](https://lingbuzz.net/lingbuzz/006319), the supplementary material of which can be found in [its repository (supplementary materials)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5898464), to which we would also redirect readers interested in more details about the experiments themselves. Note however, that this repository only contains the experimental data of participants that have been considered eligible, wheras the repository at hand also contains the original set (i.e. including ineligible participants). Furthermore, the set of accepted participants might differ in both repositories, as different criteria might have been applied back then. 

Both reports are part of our project [Position and Interpretation of adverbial PPs in German clause structure](https://ldsl.rub.de/research/projects/position-and-interpretation-of-adverbial-pps-in-german-clause-structure), which is supported by a DFG grant (KI 759/8-1/2). However, the present report is mainly concerned with methodological considerations concerning acceptability judgment tasks, and is therefore addressing a broader audience, namely researchers carrying out experiments in syntax.
